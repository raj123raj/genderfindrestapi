# genderfindrestapi
A funny way of finding gender, its probability and count by using
https://api.genderize.io?name=rachel
object		{4}
name	:	rachel
gender	:	female
probability	:	0.98
count	:	28052

Using Spring MVC, the REST API call is processed, JSON is parsed and the output is rendered in the screens.
Using Spring Mock MVC, testcases also got tested and necessary code is available.
